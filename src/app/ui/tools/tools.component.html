    <p class="text-center">
        Throughout my career I have been exposed to a wide variety of tools and technologies to various degrees. When it
        comes to my confidence and experience, then Angular comes out on top for frontend while I am comfortable with C#,
        Java or Typescript when it comes to the backend.
